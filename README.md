# Loan Default

This project aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of risk analytics within the banking and financial services sector, 
focusing on minimizing the risk of defaults and financial losses while lending to customers. 
The analysis investigates how various factors influence loan default rates and explores correlations between key financial variables and the likelihood of default.

## Key Areas of Exploration:

* Loan Characteristics: Analyzing how loan type, loan purpose, and business/commercial nature affect default probabilities.
* Credit Scoring: Assessing the impact of customer credit scores on the likelihood of loan defaults.
* Financial Variables: Investigating correlations between upfront charges, loan amount, interest rates, and property values with default tendencies.
* Patterns and Insights: Identifying patterns in loan defaults to uncover hidden risk factors and improve risk assessment strategies.
